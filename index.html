<h2>Geierlein is …</h2>

<ul id="key-features">
  <li>
    <i class="icon icon-smile"></i>
    <div>
      <h3>easy to understand</h3>
      <p>… it features a shortened version of the VAT declaration form, coping with typical needs.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <i class="icon icon-clock"></i>
    <div>
      <h3>fast &amp; simple</h3>
      <p>… it works out of the box, just unpack the ZIP archive and launch the application.  No need to configure &amp; make.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <i class="icon icon-peace"></i>
    <div>
      <h3>free &amp; open</h3>
      <p>
        … it's free software.  You don't have to rely on a black box
        doing the encryption of your private data.  You get the source,
        just have a look into it.
      </p>

  <h4>Geierlein does <em>not</em> allow to send income tax returns</h4>
  <p>
    Unfortunately it's still not possible to send returns that are due annually
    since the fiscal authorities don't allow to do that off the ERiC library
    (which is proprietary however).  It's currently not clear whether one day it
    will be possible at all.

<h2>… a desktop application in disguise …</h2>

<p>
  To mimic the look &amp; feel of a desktop application it's based on Mozilla
  XUL, the engine used by the Firefox browser.  This is, any system that's
  capable of running Firefox also is able to run Geierlein, …hence it should
  work on at least GNU/Linux, Windows &amp; MacOS.
</p>

<p>
  Here's a screenshot of the XUL-based application:

<h2>Other interfaces</h2>

<p>
  Since Geierlein's core is written in pure HTML5 &amp; JavaScript, it's not
  only cross plattform, but it's also easy to target different interfaces.  The
  primary one is the XUL application mentioned above.  If you're a console monk,
  you can use Geierlein
  <a href="https://github.com/stesie/geierlein/wiki/Node.js-command-line-interface">on
  the command line (with Node.js)</a>.
  In case you've got no XUL runner (i.e. Firefox) installed, you may want to
  serve Geierlein
  <a href="https://github.com/stesie/geierlein/wiki/Nginx-configuration">using a
  locally installed web server</a> (like Nginx).
</p>

<h2>Who's behind Geierlein?</h2>

<p>
  Geierlein is an essential part of Taxbird, a private project of me, Stefan
  Siegl.  I started the project back in 2004, mainly as I was a tax
  accountant assistant ("Steuerfachangestellter") and therefore got a natural
  interest in the topic.  Since I'm very much engaged with computers in general,
  and software development in particular, somewhen the question arose how the 
  ELSTER-project works in detail and I regretted that there was no open source
  client for it…
</p>

<p>
  Until today I've neither been a freelancer nor an entrepreneur, and therefore
  never have been obliged to file VAT declarations.  Hence I never was actually
  able to use Geierlein in production.  In case you consider the project useful,
  I'd very much appreciate a little donation to contribute to the development
  costs.
